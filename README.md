# Project Title

Flask Todo App

## Description

The Flask Todo App is a web application that allows users to manage their tasks and keep track of their to-do lists. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, updating, and deleting tasks, as well as categorizing tasks and adding notes.
## Motivation
My name is Stewart Nyaruwata student at alx africa software engineering it might look easy but lot of work was done 
The motivation behind creating the Flask Todo App was to develop a simple yet powerful task management tool that would help individuals and teams stay organized and productive. We recognized the need for a lightweight and customizable solution that can be easily deployed and used by anyone.

With the Flask Todo App, we aimed to provide a streamlined user experience that focuses on essential task management features while keeping the interface clean and intuitive. We wanted to create a tool that helps users prioritize their tasks, categorize them based on different contexts, and easily update or delete tasks as needed.

By developing this app, we wanted to empower users to take control of their daily tasks, boost their productivity, and achieve their goals more effectively. We believe that an organized and structured approach to task management can significantly improve efficiency and reduce stress in both personal and professional settings.
